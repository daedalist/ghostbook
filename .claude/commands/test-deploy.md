Test the GitHub Pages deployment locally by running the full build and deployment test process.

Steps:

1. Run `npm run test:github-pages` to build and set up the test deployment
2. Report what was built and where it's being served
3. Remind the user to test at http://localhost:3000/ghostbook/ (note the /ghostbook base path)
4. Check for any build warnings or errors that should be addressed
