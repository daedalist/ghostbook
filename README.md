# Phasmophobia Ghostbook

A web app for [Phasmophobia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/) to keep track of evidence and narrow down which ghost you are hunting (or is hunting you)!

Built with Next.js and deployed as a static site.

ðŸ”— **Live App**: [daedalist.github.io/ghostbook](https://daedalist.github.io/ghostbook/)

## Features

- **Evidence Tracking**: Click evidence to cycle through states (Not Selected â†’ Selected â†’ Ruled Out)
- **Smart Ghost Filtering**: Automatically filters possible ghosts based on your evidence
- **Evidence Disabling**: Grays out evidence that's impossible based on current selections
- **Reset Function**: Clear all evidence with one click
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daedalist/ghostbook.git
   cd ghostbook
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Available Scripts

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` - Build the app for production
- `npm start` - Serve the built app locally

### Testing & Deployment
- `npm run test:github-pages` - Test the app as it will appear on GitHub Pages
- `npm run clean` - Remove build artifacts and test files

## How to Use

1. **Select Evidence**: Click on evidence types as you discover them in-game
   - First click: Mark as "Selected" (white background)
   - Second click: Mark as "Ruled Out" (gray background with strikethrough)
   - Third click: Return to "Not Selected"

2. **View Possible Ghosts**: The right panel shows ghosts ranked by likelihood based on your evidence

3. **Evidence Auto-Disable**: Evidence that becomes impossible will be grayed out automatically

4. **Reset**: Use the "Reset" button to clear all evidence and start fresh

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with static site generation
- **React 18** - UI library
- **CSS** - Custom styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **GitHub Pages** - Static site hosting

## Development Notes

### Migration from Create React App

This project was migrated from Create React App to Next.js to take advantage of:
- Better build optimization and tree-shaking
- Automatic code splitting
- Static site generation
- Foundation for future server-side features

The app currently runs as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Next.js static export for GitHub Pages compatibility.

### Evidence State Management

Evidence states are managed using JavaScript Maps and React class component state. Each evidence type can be in one of four states:
- `NOT_SELECTED` - Default state
- `SELECTED` - User has confirmed this evidence
- `RULED_OUT` - User has confirmed this evidence is NOT present
- `DISABLED` - Evidence is impossible based on current ghost candidates

### Ghost Scoring Algorithm

Ghosts are scored based on evidence:
- +10 points for each matching primary evidence
- +5 points for each matching fake evidence  
- -10 points (elimination) for contradictory evidence

## Deployment

The app is configured for static deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. Build the static site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The `build/` directory contains all static files ready for deployment

3. GitHub Pages serves from the `/ghostbook` path, configured via `basePath` in `next.config.js`

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
