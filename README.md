# Phasmophobia Ghostbook

A little web app for [Phasmophobia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/)
to keep track of evidence and narrow down which ghost you are hunting (or is 
hunting you)!

Written in React, and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you're here for the actual app, go to [daedalist.github.io/ghostbook](https://daedalist.github.io/ghostbook/)

## Getting started

To download and tinker with this code, just do the following:

```sh

## Select commands

### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
